TrailMesh allows you to add 3D trails via an emitter (TrailEmitter), have the shape defined by a curve and colored with a gradient.

Used to implement continuous trails, where an emitter is attached to a physics body which leaves a trail behind when it is moved (for example missile or airplane trails).

Caveats:
  - Does not yet work in editor
  - Visibility is a bit buggy
  - Editor missing UI hints
